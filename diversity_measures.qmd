# Diversity Measures {#sec-diversity-measures}

This section introduces the concept of a **diversity measure** in microbial ecology.

## What is diversity?

**Diversity measurements for a microbial community are quantitative estimates of how _heterogeneous_ or _homogeneous_ that community is**. _Qualitative_ estimates of diversity can be simple. If a community is composed of identical individuals, it is clearly not diverse. However, if the members of a community differ from each other, the community is diverse to some extent.

Diversity (or the lack of it) is a **property of the community, not a property of individuals** in the community.

If we want to record or compare the level of diversity in a community, we cannot easily rely on qualitative estimates. We need to be more precise than this, and use _quantitative_ approaches. We need to know what groups are present in the community and, numerically, to what extent each group is represented.

### An example community

To help illustrate this, we went to Mars[^1] to obtain a sample (@fig-one_packet).

![A community sample, obtained from Mars](assets/images/diversity_estimates/01_one_packet.png){#fig-one_packet width=50%}

This community contains a range of individuals of different type, distinguishable by the detailed structure of their outer membranes, and also by their internal contents. The diversity of the community can be seen in (@fig-one_packet_contents).

## Exercise 1

By visual inspection of (@fig-one_packet_contents), how diverse would you say the sample is?

::: {.callout-answer}
There are clearly several different kinds of individual present, so the sample is not homogenous and is _diverse_ in some sense. But in another sense the individuals are all individually-wrapped sweets, so the sample is entirely homogeneous.

**We clearly need to be more precise about what exactly we mean, when talking about _diversity_.**
