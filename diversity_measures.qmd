# Diversity Measures {#sec-diversity-measures}

::: {.callout-note}
This section introduces the concept of a **diversity measure** in microbial ecology.

- We introduce an **example community**, obtained from Mars, to explore concepts with.
- We discuss fundamental concepts in ecological diversity:
  - **richness**
  - **evenness**

## What is diversity?

**Diversity measurements for a microbial community are quantitative estimates of how _heterogeneous_ or _homogeneous_ that community is**. _Qualitative_ estimates of diversity can be simple. If a community is composed of identical individuals, it is clearly not diverse. However, if the members of a community differ from each other, the community is diverse to some extent.

::: {.callout-important}
Diversity (or the lack of it) is a **property of the community, not a property of individuals** in the community.
:::

If we want to record the level of diversity in a community, or compare it to other communities, we cannot easily rely on qualitative estimates. We need to be more precise than this, and to use _quantitative_ approaches. We need to know what groups are present in the community and, numerically, to what extent each group is represented.

### An example community

To help illustrate this, we went to Mars[^1] to obtain a sample (@fig-one_packet).

![A community sample, obtained from Mars](assets/images/diversity_estimates/01_one_packet.png){#fig-one_packet width=50%}

This community contains a range of individuals of different type, distinguishable by the detailed structure of their outer membranes, and also by their internal contents. The diversity of the community can be seen in (@fig-one_packet_contents).

## Exercise 1

By visual inspection of @fig-one_packet_contents, how diverse would you say the sample is?

::: {.callout-answer}
There are clearly several different kinds of individual present, so the sample is not homogenous and is _diverse_ in some sense. But in another sense the individuals are all individually-wrapped sweets, so the sample is entirely homogeneous.

**We clearly need to be more precise about what exactly we mean, when talking about _diversity_**, so that others can understand exactly what we mean.

## Community richness and evenness

We usually define how _diverse_ a community is by using a **diversity index**. This is a number that reflects the distribution of different _types_ (such as microbial species) of individual that are found in a sample. There are two major concepts that contribute to diversity indices.

## Richness

The **richness** of a sample is the **number of different types that are represented in the sample**.

For example, _species richness_ is a count of the total number of species in the sample. **It does not take into acount species abundance, or relative abundance**.
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Evenness

The **evenness** of a sample reflects **how similar is the abundance of each type of thing** in the sample. The more similar the proportion of each type, the more _even_ the community.

For example, _species evenness_ reflects the relative abundances of distinct species in the sample. If a sample contains three species: $A$, $B$, and $C$, then:

- a sample with 33% $A$, 33% $B$, and 33% $C$ has **high species evenness**
- a sample with 5% $A$, 90% $B$, and 5% $C$ has **low species evenness**

## Richness and evenness in the Mars sample

We can organise the individuals in the Mars sample, as shown in @fig-one_packet_histogram. This gives us enough information to calculate species richness and evenness for this community.

### Species richness

We can easily count the number of different species, as determined by morphology and membrane features, in @fig-one_packet_histogram. There are eight (8) species, and this is a quantitative measure of species richness.

Taken in isolation though, this number doesn't tell us very much. We would need other information - maybe from other samples - to know whether eight is a large, small, or intermediate number of species. Nor does this number tell us whether all species are represented to the same extent (even if, from looking at @fig-one_packet_histogram we can tell they are not). We need to consider _evenness_ for that.

### Species evenness

We can see visually from @fig-one_packet_histogram that there are not equal amounts of each species, so the community is not perfectly even in terms of species evenness. **But the question remains open: how do we combine richness and evenness together into an _index_ or number, to understand species diversity in our sample?**

::: {.callout-important}
**We will discuss a simple measure of species diversity, _Shannon Index_, in [the next chapter](shannon_index.qmd).**
