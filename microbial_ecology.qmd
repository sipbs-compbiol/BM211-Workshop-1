## What is microbial ecology?

Microbial ecology is the scientific study of natural microbial communities. It is a hugely important, but arguably underdeveloped area of biology. Many important questions remain to be completely answered in detail:

- the composition of microbial communities
  - what microbes are found in a community?
  - what proportion of each microbe species (or other group) is present in a community?
- interactions within the community
  - is the community _stable_ (or is it growing, shrinking, or changing composition)?
  - do community members share or compete for resources, and which resources?
  - do the community members effectively operate as a larger-scale system?
- interactions of a community with other organisms
  - does the gut microbial community influence the host animal's nutrition, health, or disease status?
  - does the rhizosphere microbial community influence a plant's ability to extract nutrition or energy from the environment, and contribute to protection against pathogens?
- interactions between communities
  - when two communities come together, what does the resulting community look like?
  - are there two or more separate (or interacting communities), or do they somehow combine?
- engineering new microbial communities
  - can we predict which microbes can combine into a productive community?
  - can we choose these microbes to engineer a community that achieves a particular goal (e.g. plant protection or gut health)
  - can we perturb existing communities to make them beneficial to health or achieve some other goal?

This array of questions can be summarised more simply as [@Prosser2020-aw]:

1. Who is there?
2. What is meant by "there"?
3. Who is doing what in there?
4. What is the effect of doing â€¦ to there?
