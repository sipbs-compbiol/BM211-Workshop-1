  title     = "Putting science back into microbial ecology: a question of
               approach",
  author    = "Prosser, James I",
  abstract  = "Microbial ecology, the scientific study of interactions between
               natural microbial communities and their environments, has been
               facilitated by the application of molecular and 'omics'-based
               techniques that overcome some of the limitations of
               cultivation-based studies. This has increased emphasis on
               community ecology and 'microbiome' studies, but the majority
               address technical, rather than scientific challenges. Most are
               descriptive, do not address scientific aims or questions and are
               not designed to increase understanding or test hypotheses. The
               term 'hypothesis' is increasingly misused and critical testing
               of ideas or theory is restricted to a small minority of studies.
               This article discusses current microbial ecology research within
               the context of four approaches: description, induction,
               inference to the best explanation and deduction. The first three
               of these do not follow the established scientific method and are
               not based on scientific ecological questions. Observations are
               made and sometimes compared with published data, sometimes with
               attempts to explain findings in the context of existing ideas or
               hypotheses, but all lack objectivity and are biased by the
               observations made. By contrast, deductive studies address
               ecological questions and attempt to explain currently
               unexplained phenomena through the construction of hypotheses,
               from mechanism-based assumptions, that generate predictions that
               are then tested experimentally. Identification of key scientific
               questions, research driven by meaningful hypotheses and adoption
               of scientific method are essential for progress in microbial
               ecology, rather than the current emphasis on descriptive
               approaches that address only technical challenges. It is,
               therefore, imperative that we carefully consider and define the
               fundamental scientific questions that drive our own research and
               focus on ideas, concepts and hypotheses that can increase
               understanding, and only then consider which techniques are
               required for experimental testing. This article is part of the

               problem, which develops when pathogens acquire antimicrobial
               resistance genes (ARGs), primarily through genetic recombination
               between commensal and pathogenic microbes. The resistome is a
               collection of all ARGs. In microorganisms, the primary method of
               ARG acquisition is horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Thus,
               understanding and identifying HGTs, can provide insight into the

               DNA templates with different integrity levels, as measured by
               the DNA integrity number (DIN), we demonstrated that 16S rRNA

               vegetation growing season could potentially limit our ability to
               predict year-round ecosystem functions. We compiled a database

               include sampling of microbial community and functions outside

  abstract  = "Vertebrate decomposition results in an ephemeral disturbance of
               the surrounding environment. Microbial decomposers are
               recognized as key players in the breakdown of complex organic
               compounds, controlling carbon and nutrient fate in the ecosystem
               and potentially serving as indicators of time since death for
               forensic applications. As a result, there has been increasing
               attention on documenting the microbial communities associated
               with vertebrate decomposition, or the 'necrobiome'. These
               necrobiome studies differ in the vertebrate species,
               microhabitats (e.g. skin vs. soil), and geographic locations
               studied, but many are narrowly focused on the forensic
               application of microbial data, missing the larger opportunity to
               understand the ecology of these communities. To further our
               understanding of microbial dynamics during vertebrate
               decomposition and identify knowledge gaps, there is a need to
               assess the current works from an ecological systems perspective.
               In this review, we examine recent work pertaining to microbial
               community dynamics and succession during vertebrate (human and
               other mammals) decomposition in terrestrial ecosystems, through
               the lens of a microbial succession ecological framework. From
               this perspective, we describe three major microbial
               microhabitats (internal, external, and soil) in terms of their
               unique successional trajectories and identify three major
               knowledge gaps that remain to be addressed.",

               from Australia and the Netherlands treated with neoadjuvant ICIs

               integrated analysis with data from 115 patients with melanoma

               to clarify the association among antibiotic and probiotic
               exposure in early life, the microecology of the gut microbiota,
               and the development of antibiotic resistance; to investigate the
               long-term impact of antibiotics and probiotics on the health
               outcomes of infants and young children; and to provide a
               theoretical basis for the rational use of antibiotics and
               probiotics from a life course perspective. METHODS: The study is
               a prospective, longitudinal birth cohort study conducted in
               Shaanxi Province, China from 2018 to 2024. A total of 3,000
               eligible mother-child pairs will be enrolled from rural,
               suburban, and urban areas. The recruitment of the participants
               begins at pregnancy, and the newborns will be followed up for 2
               years at successive timepoints: within 3 days after birth, 42
               days after birth, and at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months of age.
               Sociodemographic data, environmental exposures, dietary
               patterns, psychological conditions, and medical and drug
               histories are collected. Cognitive and behavioural development
               among infants and young children and questionnaires on
               antibiotic knowledge and behaviour among caregivers will be
               collected at 12 and 24 months of age. The faecal samples are
               collected and analysed by 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing
               and quantitative PCR (qPCR) for antibiotic resistance genes.
               DISCUSSION: The findings will inform antibiotic and probiotic
               use for pregnant women and infants and contribute to
               establishing rational use strategies of antibiotics and
               probiotics for paediatricians, health practitioners, and drug
