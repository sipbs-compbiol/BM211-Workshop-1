@ARTICLE{Prosser2020-aw,
  title     = "Putting science back into microbial ecology: a question of
               approach",
  author    = "Prosser, James I",
  abstract  = "Microbial ecology, the scientific study of interactions between
               natural microbial communities and their environments, has been
               facilitated by the application of molecular and 'omics'-based
               techniques that overcome some of the limitations of
               cultivation-based studies. This has increased emphasis on
               community ecology and 'microbiome' studies, but the majority
               address technical, rather than scientific challenges. Most are
               descriptive, do not address scientific aims or questions and are
               not designed to increase understanding or test hypotheses. The
               term 'hypothesis' is increasingly misused and critical testing
               of ideas or theory is restricted to a small minority of studies.
               This article discusses current microbial ecology research within
               the context of four approaches: description, induction,
               inference to the best explanation and deduction. The first three
               of these do not follow the established scientific method and are
               not based on scientific ecological questions. Observations are
               made and sometimes compared with published data, sometimes with
               attempts to explain findings in the context of existing ideas or
               hypotheses, but all lack objectivity and are biased by the
               observations made. By contrast, deductive studies address
               ecological questions and attempt to explain currently
               unexplained phenomena through the construction of hypotheses,
               from mechanism-based assumptions, that generate predictions that
               are then tested experimentally. Identification of key scientific
               questions, research driven by meaningful hypotheses and adoption
               of scientific method are essential for progress in microbial
               ecology, rather than the current emphasis on descriptive
               approaches that address only technical challenges. It is,
               therefore, imperative that we carefully consider and define the
               fundamental scientific questions that drive our own research and
               focus on ideas, concepts and hypotheses that can increase
               understanding, and only then consider which techniques are
               required for experimental testing. This article is part of the
               theme issue 'Conceptual challenges in microbial community
               ecology'.",
