  title     = "Putting science back into microbial ecology: a question of
               approach",
  author    = "Prosser, James I",
  abstract  = "Microbial ecology, the scientific study of interactions between
               natural microbial communities and their environments, has been
               facilitated by the application of molecular and 'omics'-based
               techniques that overcome some of the limitations of
               cultivation-based studies. This has increased emphasis on
               community ecology and 'microbiome' studies, but the majority
               address technical, rather than scientific challenges. Most are
               descriptive, do not address scientific aims or questions and are
               not designed to increase understanding or test hypotheses. The
               term 'hypothesis' is increasingly misused and critical testing
               of ideas or theory is restricted to a small minority of studies.
               This article discusses current microbial ecology research within
               the context of four approaches: description, induction,
               inference to the best explanation and deduction. The first three
               of these do not follow the established scientific method and are
               not based on scientific ecological questions. Observations are
               made and sometimes compared with published data, sometimes with
               attempts to explain findings in the context of existing ideas or
               hypotheses, but all lack objectivity and are biased by the
               observations made. By contrast, deductive studies address
               ecological questions and attempt to explain currently
               unexplained phenomena through the construction of hypotheses,
               from mechanism-based assumptions, that generate predictions that
               are then tested experimentally. Identification of key scientific
               questions, research driven by meaningful hypotheses and adoption
               of scientific method are essential for progress in microbial
               ecology, rather than the current emphasis on descriptive
               approaches that address only technical challenges. It is,
               therefore, imperative that we carefully consider and define the
               fundamental scientific questions that drive our own research and
               focus on ideas, concepts and hypotheses that can increase
               understanding, and only then consider which techniques are
               required for experimental testing. This article is part of the
               theme issue 'Conceptual challenges in microbial community
               ecology'.",

               reconstructed from metagenome data. In the last few years, many
               thousands of MAGs have been reported in the literature, for a
               variety of environments and host-associated microbiota,
               including humans. MAGs have helped us better understand
               microbial populations and their interactions with the

               species, therefore helping to decrease the so-called microbial
               dark matter. However, questions about the biological reality of
               MAGs have not, in general, been properly addressed. In this
               review, I define the notions of hypothetical MAGs and conserved
               hypothetical MAGs. These notions should help with the

  abstract  = "Antimicrobial resistance is a major global public health
               problem, which develops when pathogens acquire antimicrobial
               resistance genes (ARGs), primarily through genetic recombination
               between commensal and pathogenic microbes. The resistome is a
               collection of all ARGs. In microorganisms, the primary method of
               ARG acquisition is horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Thus,
               understanding and identifying HGTs, can provide insight into the
               mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance transmission and
               dissemination. The use of high-throughput sequencing
               technologies has made the analysis of ARG sequences feasible and
               accessible. In particular, the metagenomic approach has
               facilitated the identification of community-based antimicrobial
               resistance. This approach is useful, as it allows access to the
               genomic data in an environmental sample without the need to
               isolate and culture microorganisms prior to analysis. Here, we
               aimed to reflect on the challenges of analyzing metagenomic data
               in the three main approaches for studying antimicrobial
               resistance: (i) analysis of microbial diversity, (ii) functional
               gene analysis, and (iii) searching the most complete and

               samples is critical for investigating the interplay between the
               microbiome and its host, as well as for assessing the accuracy
               and precision of the relative microbial composition which can be
               strongly biased in low microbial biomass samples. In the present
               study, we demonstrate that digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) can
               provide accurate quantification of the total copy number of the
               16S rRNA gene, the gene usually exploited for assessing total
               bacterial abundance in metagenomic DNA samples. Notably, using
               DNA templates with different integrity levels, as measured by
               the DNA integrity number (DIN), we demonstrated that 16S rRNA
               copy number quantification is strongly affected by DNA quality
               and determined a precise correlation between quantification
               underestimation and DNA degradation levels. Therefore, we
               propose an input DNA mass correction, according to the observed
               DIN value, which could prevent inaccurate quantification of 16S
               copy number in degraded metagenomic DNAs. Our results highlight
               that a preliminary evaluation of the metagenomic DNA integrity
               should be considered before performing metagenomic analyses of
               different samples, both for the assessment of the reliability of
