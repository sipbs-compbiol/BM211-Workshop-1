    "section": "3.2 Answering questions about microbial ecology using molecular techniques",
    "text": "3.2 Answering questions about microbial ecology using molecular techniques\nMolecular techniques enabled by modern sequencing approaches, such as amplicon marker sequencing (e.g. 16S, ITS1 methods) - also known as metabarcoding - and sequencing the entire genomic DNA of a complex sample - also known as metagenomics - have become the dominant approach to understanding microbial community composition (Boughner and Singh 2016). These tools give rapid insights into the complex composition of microbial communities that are unattainable using laborious, time-consuming culture-based techniques.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetagenomics vs Metabarcoding\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two words are quite similar, but it is important to distinguish between\n\nmetabarcoding: sequencing a single marker sequence from a population\nmetagenomics: deep sequencing of the entire genomic DNA material in a sample, often attempting to assemble representative genomes from the data\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to their speed and the scale of data they can produce, these molecular techniques have other advantages:\n\nThe (sequence) data collected can be preserved and shared, alongside metadata describing the experiment, in public databases. This enables reanalysis and integration into larger-scale studies.\nFastidious organisms, or those that might be outcompeted in a laboratory culture, can be sequenced and identified.\nOrganisms present in low numbers can be sequenced and identified.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese molecular techniques answer the question of “Who is there?”, in two ways:\n\nThey tell us what kinds of organism are present (often to species or genus level)\nThey give us a relative count of how much of each kind of organism is present\n\nTaken together, these answers tell us the diversity of the community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will introduce measures of community diversity in a later section.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.1 Which organisms are present?\nBoth metabarcoding and metagenomics can tell us which microorganisms are present in a biological or environmental sample.\n\n3.2.1.1 Metabarcoding\nIn metabarcoding, we use the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and primers targeted specifically to amplify a marker sequence: a gene fragment or other stretch of DNA that we believe to be present in all organisms of interest. For bacteria, this is usually a fragment of the 16S rRNA gene. For fungi and other eukaryotic mocroorganisms it may be a fragment of the ITS1 (Internally Transcribed Spacer 1) region.\nThese regions of the genome acquire sequence changes as their organisms evolve over time, such that variants of the marker sequence can be associated with a particular group of microorganisms, usually at the species or genus level. By amplifying and then sequencing the marker sequence from all suitable organisms in the sample, we can identify the marker sequence variants, and then compare these to databases of known sequences, to identify which organisms are present.\n\n\n3.2.1.2 Metagenomics\nA similar principle applies with metagenomics: we sequence the sample and then compare the resulting sequences to a database containing sequences of known organisms, and use this to identify which of them are present in our sample. Differences between the methods arise mainly because this approach is untargeted - we do not know in advance what sequences we will recover - and generates very large amounts of data. Three of the main consequences of this are:\n\nWe can compare individual sequencing reads to the database of known sequences, but due to the large amount of sequence data (in comparison to metabarcoding) we have to do this using special techniques like \\(k\\)-mer alignment, rather than direct sequence comparison (Wood and Salzberg 2014).\nWe can assemble near-complete and complete genomes from the data: Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs). (Setubal 2021).\nWe can obtain much more information than simple organism identity, such as the presence or absence of individual genes or gene functions, such as antimicrobial resistance genes (Abreu, Perdigão, and Almeida 2020).\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 How much of each organism is present?\nWhichever method we use to sequence a biological sample, we can obtain a list of the organisms that are present. This tells us something about the composition of the sample, but not everything. There is clearly a difference between one community that is 50% Escherichia coli and 50% Staphylococcus aureus, and another community that is 99% S. aureus and 1% E. coli. But how can we distinguish between the two?\nIn both metabarcoding and metagenomics we can count the number of sequences that correspond to each of the organism types we have identified. For metabarcoding, this might be the count of each amplicon sequence corresponding to a microbial genus. For metagenomics, this might be the number of reads assigned to a microbial species by a tool like Kraken.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMolecular techniques only estimate organism abundance\n\n\n\n\n\nAll counts of organisms, by both methods, are strictly estimates of the representation of each organism in the sample. There are many factors that influence the way this estimate may very from the actual amount or proportion of any organism in the sample, including:\n\nDNA quality (Manzari et al. 2020)\nlaboratory technique (sample spillover or other handling problems)\nPCR artefacts (especially for low-biomass samples)\nsequence database integrity\nvariable accuracy of associating a sequence with an organism or group (taxonomic misassignment)\n\n\n\n\nWith metagenomic analyses that result in assembled MAGs, an additional way of estimating the amount of each organism present is possible: we can count the number of reads that contribute to each MAG assembly. These reads are then assigned the same identity as that of the MAG itself.\nWe refer to the count of each distinct group of microbes as its abundance."

    "section": "4.1 What is diversity?",
    "text": "4.1 What is diversity?\nDiversity measurements for a microbial community are quantitative estimates of how heterogeneous or homogeneous that community is. Qualitative estimates of diversity can be simple. If a community is composed of identical individuals, it is clearly not diverse. However, if the members of a community differ from each other, the community is diverse to some extent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiversity (or the lack of it) is a property of the community, not a property of individuals in the community.\n\n\n\nIf we want to record or compare the level of diversity in a community, we cannot easily rely on qualitative estimates. We need to be more precise than this, and use quantitative approaches. We need to know what groups are present in the community and, numerically, to what extent each group is represented.\n\n4.1.1 An example community\nTo help illustrate this, we went to Mars1 to obtain a sample (Figure 4.1).\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: A community sample, obtained from Mars\n\n\nThis community contains a range of individuals of different type, distinguishable by the detailed structure of their outer membranes, and also by their internal contents. The diversity of the community can be seen in (Figure 4.2).\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: A detailed view of the Mars sample, showing community diversity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy visual inspection of (Figure 4.2), how diverse would you say the sample is?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are clearly several different kinds of individual present, so the sample is not homogenous and is diverse in some sense. But in another sense the individuals are all individually-wrapped sweets, so the sample is entirely homogeneous.\nWe clearly need to be more precise about what exactly we mean, when talking about diversity."
