    "text": "3.2 Answering questions about microbial ecology using molecular techniques\nMolecular techniques enabled by modern sequencing approaches, such as amplicon marker sequencing (e.g. 16S, ITS1 methods) - also known as metabarcoding - and sequencing the entire genomic DNA of a complex sample - also known as metagenomics - have become the dominant approach to understanding microbial community composition (Boughner and Singh 2016). These tools give rapid insights into the complex composition of microbial communities that are unattainable using laborious, time-consuming culture-based techniques.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetagenomics vs Metabarcoding\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two words are quite similar, but it is important to distinguish between\n\nmetabarcoding: sequencing a single marker sequence from a population\nmetagenomics: deep sequencing of the entire genomic DNA material in a sample, often attempting to assemble representative genomes from the data\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to their speed and the scale of data they can produce, these molecular techniques have other advantages:\n\nThe (sequence) data collected can be preserved and shared, alongside metadata describing the experiment, in public databases. This enables reanalysis and integration into larger-scale studies.\nFastidious organisms, or those that might be outcompeted in a laboratory culture, can be sequenced and identified.\nOrganisms present in low numbers can be sequenced and identified.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese molecular techniques answer the question of “Who is there?”, in two ways:\n\nThey tell us what kinds of organism are present (often to species or genus level)\nThey give us a relative count of how much of each kind of organism is present\n\nTaken together, these answers tell us the diversity of the community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will introduce measures of community diversity in a later section.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.1 Which organisms are present?\nBoth metabarcoding and metagenomics can tell us which microorganisms are present in a biological or environmental sample.\n\n3.2.1.1 Metabarcoding\nIn metabarcoding, we use the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and primers targeted specifically to amplify a marker sequence: a gene fragment or other stretch of DNA that we believe to be present in all organisms of interest. For bacteria, this is usually a fragment of the 16S rRNA gene. For fungi and other eukaryotic mocroorganisms it may be a fragment of the ITS1 (Internally Transcribed Spacer 1) region.\nThese regions of the genome acquire sequence changes as their organisms evolve over time, such that variants of the marker sequence can be associated with a particular group of microorganisms, usually at the species or genus level. By amplifying and then sequencing the marker sequence from all suitable organisms in the sample, we can identify the marker sequence variants, and then compare these to databases of known sequences, to identify which organisms are present.\n\n\n3.2.1.2 Metagenomics\nA similar principle applies with metagenomics: we sequence the sample and then compare the resulting sequences to a database containing sequences of known organisms, and use this to identify which of them are present in our sample. Differences between the methods arise mainly because this approach is untargeted - we do not know in advance what sequences we will recover - and generates very large amounts of data. Three of the main consequences of this are:\n\nWe can compare individual sequencing reads to the database of known sequences, but due to the large amount of sequence data (in comparison to metabarcoding) we have to do this using special techniques like \\(k\\)-mer alignment, rather than direct sequence comparison (Wood and Salzberg 2014).\nWe can assemble near-complete and complete genomes from the data: Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs). (Setubal 2021).\nWe can obtain much more information than simple organism identity, such as the presence or absence of individual genes or gene functions, such as antimicrobial resistance genes (Abreu, Perdigão, and Almeida 2020).\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 How much of each organism is present?\nWhichever method we use to sequence a biological sample, we can obtain a list of the organisms that are present. This tells us something about the composition of the sample, but not everything. There is clearly a difference between one community that is 50% Escherichia coli and 50% Staphylococcus aureus, and another community that is 99% S. aureus and 1% E. coli. But how can we distinguish between the two?\nIn both metabarcoding and metagenomics we can count the number of sequences that correspond to each of the organism types we have identified. For metabarcoding, this might be the count of each amplicon sequence corresponding to a microbial genus. For metagenomics, this might be the number of reads assigned to a microbial species by a tool like Kraken.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMolecular techniques only estimate organism abundance\n\n\n\n\n\nAll counts of organisms, by both methods, are strictly estimates of the representation of each organism in the sample. There are many factors that influence the way this estimate may very from the actual amount or proportion of any organism in the sample, including:\n\nDNA quality (Manzari et al. 2020)\nlaboratory technique (sample spillover or other handling problems)\nPCR artefacts (especially for low-biomass samples)\nsequence database integrity\nvariable accuracy of associating a sequence with an organism or group (taxonomic misassignment)\n\n\n\n\nWith metagenomic analyses that result in assembled MAGs, an additional way of estimating the amount of each organism present is possible: we can count the number of reads that contribute to each MAG assembly. These reads are then assigned the same identity as that of the MAG itself.\nWe refer to the count of each distinct group of microbes as its abundance."

    "text": "4.1 What is diversity?\nDiversity measurements for a microbial community are quantitative estimates of how heterogeneous or homogeneous that community is. Qualitative estimates of diversity can be simple. If a community is composed of identical individuals, it is clearly not diverse. However, if the members of a community differ from each other, the community is diverse to some extent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiversity (or the lack of it) is a property of the community, not a property of individuals in the community.\n\n\n\nIf we want to record the level of diversity in a community, or compare it to other communities, we cannot easily rely on qualitative estimates. We need to be more precise than this, and to use quantitative approaches. We need to know what groups are present in the community and, numerically, to what extent each group is represented.\n\n4.1.1 An example community\nTo help illustrate this, we went to Mars1 to obtain a sample (Figure 4.1).\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: A community sample, obtained from Mars\n\n\nThis community contains a range of individuals of different type, distinguishable by the detailed structure of their outer membranes, and also by their internal contents. The diversity of the community can be seen in (Figure 4.2).\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: A detailed view of the Mars sample, showing community diversity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy visual inspection of Figure 4.2, how diverse would you say the sample is?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are clearly several different kinds of individual present, so the sample is not homogenous and is diverse in some sense. But in another sense the individuals are all individually-wrapped sweets, so the sample is entirely homogeneous.\nWe clearly need to be more precise about what exactly we mean, when talking about diversity, so that others can understand exactly what we mean."

There are eight (8) species, and this is a quantitative measure of species richness.\nTaken in isolation though, this number doesn’t tell us very much. We would need other information - maybe from other samples - to know whether eight is a large, small, or intermediate number of species. Nor does this number tell us whether all species are represented to the same extent (even if, from looking at Figure 4.3 we can tell they are not). We need to consider evenness for that.\n\n\n4.3.2 Species evenness\nWe can see visually from Figure 4.3 that there are not equal amounts of each species, so the community is not perfectly even in terms of species evenness. But the question remains open: how do we combine richness and evenness together into an index or number, to understand species diversity in our sample?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will discuss a simple measure of species diversity, Shannon Index, in the next chapter."

This name reflects that, although a community might contain a certain number of species, if some species are only present in very low abundance, they are not contributing significantly to the community, and they are effectively not present, and the effective number of species is less - maybe much less - than the richness of the community.\nFor example:\n\nA community with three species in equal proportions, e.g. 33% \\(A\\), 33% \\(B\\), and 33% \\(C\\) clearly has three equally-contributing species. We might expect the effective number of species to be three.\nA community dominated by a single species, e.g. 1% \\(A\\), 1% \\(B\\), and 98% \\(C\\) might effectively have only one species: species \\(C\\).\n\nBy taking the exponential of the Shannon Index, we calculate a value known as the effective number of species, or Diversity (\\(D\\)) of a community.

Justify your answer.\n\n\n\n🟡 Loading\n  webR...\n\n  \n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Shannon Index for this community is \\(H = 0.97\\), and the Effective Number of Species is \\(D = 2.64\\).\nAs we know there are eight species (technically-speaking, taxonomic genera) in the community, and the effective number of species is much lower than this, we would conclude that the community is uneven/not very diverse, and dominated by a small number of genera.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample solution code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Create a dataframe describing the community\ndfm &lt;- data.frame(species=c(\"Abiotrophia\", \"Peptostreptococcus\",\n                            \"Corynebacterium\", \"Eubacterium\", \"Moraxella\", \n                            \"Neisseria\", \"Campylobacter\", \"Desulfovibrio\"),\n                  count=c(1.27e4, 1.84e3, 2.41e5, 4.92e3, 7.31e4, 1.88e6,\n                          8.23e4, 3.11e6))\ndfm$p.i &lt;- dfm$count / sum(dfm$count)\ndfm$h.i &lt;- dfm$p.i * log(dfm$p.i)\n\n# Calculate the Shannon Index and Effective Number of Species\nH = -sum(dfm$h.i)\nD = exp(H)\n\nc(H, D)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stacked bar chart below represents the distribution of species in a community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the slider in the interactive graph to visualise different communities containing the same six species, but having different counts in each community, then consider the questions below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the Plot and the Data tabs to understand what’s going on with the data.\n\n\n\n\ndata = FileAttachment(\"assets/data/01_communities.csv\").csv({ typed: true })\n\nfiltered = data.filter(function(community_data) {\n  return community_id == community_data.community;\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nviewof community_id = Inputs.range(\n  [1, 6], \n  {value: 1, step: 1, label: \"Community ID:\"}\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotData\n\n\n\nresult = {\n  let totcount = 0;\n  let pi = [];\n  let hi = [];\n\n  for (let i = 0; i &lt; 6; ++i) {\n    totcount += filtered[i].count;\n  }\n  \n  for (let i = 0; i &lt; 6; ++i) {\n    pi[i] = filtered[i].count / totcount;\n    hi[i] = pi[i] * Math.log(pi[i]);\n  }\n  \n  let h_ex2 = -hi.reduce((a, b) =&gt; a + b, 0);\n  let d_ex2 = Math.exp(h_ex2);\n  \n  return [h_ex2, d_ex2];\n}\n\nPlot.plot({\n  color: {legend: true,\n          scheme: \"Viridis\"},\n  marginLeft: 0.3 * width,\n  marginRight: 0.3 * width,\n  marks: [\n    Plot.barY(filtered, {x: \"community\", y: \"count\", fill: \"species\"})\n  ]\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot.plot({\n  height: 100,\n  marks: [\n    Plot.frame(),\n    Plot.text([\"This is community \" + filtered[0].community + \".\\n\" +\n               \"Its Shannon Index is \" + result[0].toFixed(2) + \".\\n\" +\n               \"The Effective Number of Species is \" + result[1].toFixed(2) + \".\\n\"],\n               {frameAnchor: \"middle\",\n                fontSize: 16})\n  ]\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInputs.table(filtered)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot.plot({\n  height: 100,\n  marks: [\n    Plot.frame(),\n    Plot.text([\"This is community \" + filtered[0].community + \".\\n\" +\n               \"Its Shannon Index is \" + result[0].toFixed(2) + \".\\n\" +\n               \"The Effective Number of Species is \" + result[1].toFixed(2) + \".\\n\"],\n               {frameAnchor: \"middle\",\n                fontSize: 16})\n  ]\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompare communities 1 and 2. What is more important for Shannon Index (\\(H\\)) and Effective Number of Species (\\(D\\)): count, or relative proportion?\nDo you think that relative proportion is estimated more accurately for large or small counts? How would that affect estimates of \\(H\\) and \\(D\\) in communities with a small number of members?\nCompare communities 3 and 5. Are \\(H\\) and \\(D\\) similar for these communities? Do their populations have the same distribution?\nIs having a similar Shannon Index and/or Effective Number of Species sufficient to say that two communities are similar?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth communities 1 and 2 are completely even, with \\(H=1.79\\) and \\(D=6\\). The population size of community 2 is 10,000 times that of community 1. Relative proportion is more important than counts of individuals.\nWith a small population, the effect of miscounting on proportion of a species may be more significant. Miscounting 10 individuals for a species is unlikely to affect calculations much if there are 1,000 individuals of that species. But if there were only 20, the effect would be very large. Counting errors are often a constant size, so more significant in small populations, and more likely to introduce noise to the estimate of diversity.\nThe values of \\(H\\) (1.66 in both cases) and \\(D\\) (5.27 for community 3 and 5.25 for community 5) are similar. However, community 5 has four species with equally large, and two with equally small abundance. Community 3 has six species with different abundances. They are not the same distribution.\nThe answers above show that: (i) \\(H\\) and \\(D\\) do not inform us about the overall size of the population; (ii) populations with different distributions of species can give the same values of \\(H\\) and \\(D\\). These are significant differences and sharing the same Shannon Index or Effective Number of Species is not enough to say that two populations are the same."
